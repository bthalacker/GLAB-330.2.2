Picked my own dataset: how many times 8 students went to a coffee shop in a month

Added up the numbers and found the average (mean)

Subtracted the mean from each number and squared the results

Added those up and divided by how many data points to get the variance

Took the square root of that to get the standard deviation

Final result: 2.55, so on average, each studentâ€™s number of visits was about 2.55 away from the group average of 7.
